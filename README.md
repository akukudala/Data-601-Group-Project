# Data-601-Group-Project
Linear analysis comparison of multiple factors in the prediction of academic success

This project was assigned as the cumulative project for DATA 601 and was completed by Jessica Reynolds, Adam Raabe, Akshitha Kukudala, and Avanti Dasre.

The project is composed of several parts:
We have an Excel file containing all of the raw data that we used to do our analysis.  Information about sources and column names is present on the first sheet,followed by several years, including those which we did not end up using (2019-2021).

We also have a Jupyter notebook.  This was a cumulative effort by Adam Raabe and Akshitha Kukudala, whose codes were merged into one document, located here. 

Finally, we have Jessica's R code that was used to process the actual linear analysis of the visualizations made in the Jupyter notebook.

There was a stand-alone presentation, as well as a stand-alone project write up submitted in class.

## NOTE ##
In order to run the "Combined Akshitha + Adam notebooks.ipynb", both cleaned data sets are required.  Akshitha's half of the code uses "Cleaned_data601.xlsx" and Adam's half of the code uses "Cleaned Graduation Factors Data for MD, VA, DC by year, 2015-2021.xlsx".
